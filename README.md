# Information Security Repository

Welcome to the Reboare/Booj Security wiki!

This was a fork of the [https://github.com/xapax/security](https://github.com/xapax/security) and [https://github.com/aranisec/security](https://github.com/aranisec/security) repositories, so the majority of the work in here is due to them, but I'll be adding and editing as I go through, so the majority of it from here on out will be my own work.

If you feel like this is a good start, but you want to add and remove things and just fork it and make it yours.  Hopefully we can all learn from each other in that way.

I will not be covering reverse-engineering, binary exploitation or topics in that vein in this book.  Those topics are very broad and would take up far too much room and leave the book with even less direction than it currently has.
