# Compiling and Editing exploits

We often find exploits that do not work out of the box. Typical problems we encounter are:

* Payload needs to be changed
* Return-address is incorrect



Compiling exploits for windows on Linux can be a bit of a hassle.

```
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc exploit.c -o exploit
```

For 32bit

```
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 40564.c -o 40564 -lws2_32
```
